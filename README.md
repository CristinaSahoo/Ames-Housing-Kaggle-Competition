## Problem Statement

The Ames housing dataset contains detailed information about homes that were sold between 2006 and 2010, along with their sale price.  Our real estate agents  want to be able to advise  their selling clients on the best sale price for their home. This project aims to analyze the Ames housing dataset and create a model that predicts the sale price of a home.


## Why is this important?

As was shown by the 2008 financial crisis, it is essential for the economy that the amount of a bankâ€™s real estate lending matches the actual value of the real estate. Getting a good estimate of the price of a house is hard even for the most seasoned real estate agents.

## Brief Summary of Analysis

We looked at real estate data for homes sold in Ames, IA between 2006 and 2010. We cleaned the data, then performed exploratory data analysis to identify the best features we could use to design a model that predicts the sale price of a home. With these features, we looked at several model options which we then ran accross our testing data. Each model was scored using the same metrics, and the model with the best scores was chosen as the production model. We finished with conclusions and recommendations for the given problem.

There are two important phases we need to consider when tuning our model:  
Feature selection  
Normalizing our target  

Feature selection is a technique where we choose those features in our data that contribute most to the target variable. In other words we choose the best predictors for the target variable. Here, we used a heat map to rank the features by how correlated they are with the sale price.

Feature importance is an inbuilt class that comes with Tree Based Classifiers. We used Extra Tree Classifier for extracting the top features for the dataset.

Logarithmic transformation is a convenient means of transforming a highly skewed variable into a more normalized dataset. Here, we did just that for our target variable, sale price, which improved our model.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

**Conclusions:**  

The coefficients and the intercept define our model. Below we have a graph showing how each feature impacts our target, the sale price, when we are making a prediction.

*What this means: for every 1 unit (standard deviation) increase in a variable, holding all other features constant, we can expect a percentage increase/decrease in a home's price, on average.*

We recommend our realtors use this model to predict the sale price of a home when working with their selling clients.

For 1 point increase in the quality of the kitchen, holding all other features constant, we can expect, on average, a 5% increase in the price of a home.

If the home has a fireplace, the increase in the price is estimated at about 4%.

For 1 year increase in the age of a home, we can expect a decrease of about 0.12% in the price.  


**Next steps:**

Further evaluate and tune the model for a more accurate prediction. Consider adding/engineering more features. Additional research is needed into specific neighborhoods and other factors that influenced home prices, such as the market crash in 2008.
